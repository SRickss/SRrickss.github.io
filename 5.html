<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today</p>:
"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
I definitely won't be passing any cars.

<h5>My first day of the trip!I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</h5> <ul><li>cellphone</li><li>iPod</li><li>digital camera</li><li>and a protein bar</li></ul>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</q></ul>
